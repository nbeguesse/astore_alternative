"ANGELBOY is a beautifully illustrated Manga comic that delivers when it comes to plot, depth and anticipation. The illustrations are superb -- Beguesse is a gifted Manga artist and her artwork alone makes this book worth reading. They're evocative and memorable and they work well with the compelling storyline, which has slightly Christian overtones. On the one hand, the story is simple enough -- good versus evil; on the other hand, there's enough plot depth, bloodshed and violence to make this a bit of a thriller - the reader never knows what will happen next...."<br><div>-<i>IndieReader</i></div><br /><br /><div>"A tale with an ethereal hero that's just getting started, but profound nonetheless, and illustrative in every sense." -<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></div><div></div><br /><br />"A fast-paced manga with an engaging story." -&nbsp;<i>Kayti Nika Raet, author of Niko</i><br /><br />"When I opened up a copy of volume 1 and glanced through as she was talking, I could see that she had placed a bit of her soul in each page of this book. Everything was hand drawn, which is very rare in the industry today...&nbsp;To my surprise it wasn't close to being an average superhero comic. The main character goes through normal human issues and emotions even in his afterlife. I did love it and cannot wait for Vol. 2." -<i>Seth Greenwood, author of Gale</i>
